**Instructor**: Sam Marshalik (MathWorks)

**Title**: MATLAB Parallel Computing Hands-On Workshop

During this hands-on workshop, a MathWorks engineer will introduce you to parallel and distributed
computing in MATLAB with a focus on speeding up your application code and offloading compute. By working
through common scenarios and workflows using hands-on demos, you will gain an understanding of the
parallel constructs in MATLAB, their capabilities, and some of the common hurdles that youâ€™ll encounter
when using them. You'll also learn how to run your MATLAB code on Compute Canada resources.

**Important**: Please download and install MATLAB on your laptop from <a
href="https://www.mathworks.com/downloads" target="_blank">this page</a>. If you do not have a
school-wide license, you can use <a
