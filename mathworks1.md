**Title**: Data Analysis with MATLAB

During this hands-on workshop, a MathWorks engineer will introduce you to parallel and distributed
computing in MATLAB with a focus on speeding up your application code and offloading compute. By working
through common scenarios and workflows using hands-on demos, you will gain an understanding of the
parallel constructs in MATLAB, their capabilities, and some of the common hurdles that youâ€™ll encounter
when using them. You'll also learn how to run your MATLAB code on Compute Canada resources.
