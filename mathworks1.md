**Title**: Data Analysis with MATLAB

Join us to learn many of the most used features and capabilities in MATLAB, a high-level language and
interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming.

In this session, a MathWorks Engineer will demonstrate data analysis features in the most recent releases
of MATLAB and toolboxes, complete with code examples and resources that you can revisit following the
training.

**Important**: Please download and install MATLAB on your laptop from <a
