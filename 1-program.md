# Program

Time estimates below are maximum, can be reduced if necessary.

Alex Razoumov
- *Introduction to HPC* (full-day)
- *Chapel* (full-day)
- *Scientific visualization with ParaView* (full-day)

Grigory Shamov (**please put in time estimates for these sessions**)
- Singularity
- Torque-to-Slurm migration (say as part of a larger Intro to CC HPC session)
  - Alex: could be a simple set of slides / cheat sheet for Torque-to-Slurm command translations
- perhaps some other things

Ali Kerrache (**please put in time estimates for these sessions**)
- general intro to Molecular Dynamics
- OpenMP
- perhaps some other things

"One senior and important CS professor"
- intro to parallel programming in general? **need to find the specific topic**

posssible other topics
- genomics
  - GenAP portal? (better fit for CC audience?)
  - GSC?
  - using Galaxy on Cedar?
  - **consult with Jamie Rosner**
- HPC Python
- other high-level programming languages (MATLAB, Julia)
- hybrid programming with MPI+OpenMP
- GPU programming with CUDA and OpenACC
- Jupyter notebooks and scientific computing in Python
- CC cloud
- Hadoop, Spark, data science
- MPI (probably not since we'll have Chapel)
