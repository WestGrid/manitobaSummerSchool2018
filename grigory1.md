**Instructor**: Grigory Shamov (University of Manitoba)

**Title**: Using Clouds and Containers

A beginner's introduction to using two kinds of technologies: Clouds and Containers. The morning session will cover Clouds/VM technology;  the afternoon session will build on that, explainng a related technology, Linux Containers, of which Singularity is one of the most popular ones for the HPC workloads.

**Objectives**
- Give a general intro to the Virtual Machines and Linux Containers
- Getting started using ComputeCanada Arbutus OpenStack Cloud
- Getting started with Singularity HPC containers 

**Target audience**: everyone interested in using Clouds and/or HPC

**Level**: beginner (Morning) to intermediate (Afternoon)

**Prerequisites**: basic knowledge of Linux command line; basic familiarity with installing software on
one of the Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.).

**Setup**:
- *Laptop software*: SSH client (built-in on Mac/Linux, on Windows MobaXTerm or PuTTY)

## Morning session: *Using ComputeCanada OpenStack Cloud*

**Outline**:
- What is Cloud? Cloud services delivery modes, private and public clouds. 
- Virtualization technology: Virtual Machines, and contaners.
- Overview of the ComputeCanada Arbutus system.
- Walkthrough of creating a VM on Arbutus.
- Securing your VMs, installing software, etc.
- Next steps: ways to organize your computations on the Cloud.

**Duration**: 3 hours

## Afternoon session: *Containers for HPC: Singularity*

**Outline**:
- What are the Linux Containers, and how are they different from the VMs?
- What are they good for? Reproducible computing, and Mobility of computing.
- A brief overwief of Docker and DockerHUb
- From Docker to Singularity
- Installing Singularity (might use cloud VMs created in the Morning session)
- Building and Exploring the containers: ins and outs, accessing filesystems
- Using Docker containers with Singularity
- Intro to Singularity build service and container repository: SingularityHub
- Next steps: examples of production-ready use cases for Singularity (OSG, TensorFlow, BioIformatics
  pipelines, custom build environments).

**Duration**: 3 hours
