**Title**: Introduction to Parallel Programming using OpenMP

There are many avanced parallel programming techincs (like MPI, OpenACC, ...). In this course, we will discuss OpenMP, an Application Programming Interface for shared-memory machines. Compared to MPI, OpenMP is easy to implement. Starting from a serial code, one can add only few lines and the code will run in parallel and take advantage of the resources available within one node. During this course, we will introduce the most usefull OpenMP constructs. The examples will be presented in different version of the programminh languages: C/CPP and Fortran.
