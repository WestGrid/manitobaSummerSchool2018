**Title**: Scientific computing with PETSc

Introduction to scientific computing using PETSc.

**Objectives**:
- Give general intro to numerical linear algebra with PETSc.
- Introduce PETSc solvers for ODEs and PDEs: how to set up and solve linear, nonlinear, and initial value
  problems in PETSc.
- Introduce HPC with PETSc, look at PETSc data structures built on top of MPI.
- Provided with a series of examples and practical exercises, the attendees will run code on the cluster.

**Contents:**
- Morning:
  - what is PETSc, and why it is useful
  - finding documentation for PETSc
  - loading PETSc on Cedar
  - the main data structures we will be working with (Vec, Mat, DMDA) and how to manipulate them in parallel
  - solving linear systems by preconditioned iterative methods
  - solving linear systems by direct methods
- Afternoon:
  - setting up and solving nonlinear problems
  - something went wrong! checking your Jacobians
  - setting up and solving initial value problems
  - profiling your PETSc code. Scaling
  - estimating memory usage
