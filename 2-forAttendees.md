# Instructions for attendees

Morning sessions will be 9:00am-12:00pm, and the afternoon sessions 1:00pm-4:00pm. All sessions will take
place in Robson Hall (Faculty of Law) that you can find <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WVZhc3hVGT62"
target="_blank">here on Google Maps</a>, in rooms 206 and 207.

These pages will continue to be updated as details are confirmed for room assignments, session times and
detailed course information.

**Important**: All attendees must bring their laptops and power cords (if your battery does not last all
day). Don't forget to check details and prerequisites for each course, including software requirements
for your laptop under **Setup** > *Laptop software*. Please install the required software before coming
to class.

Before the start of the summer school **all eligible attendees are encouraged to obtain**:

1. Their Compute Canada acounts. You can find detailed instructions
   [here](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account). Please
   note that the same Compute Canada account will let you log in to both Cedar and Graham clusters.
  - If you are not eligible to apply for a Compute Canada account (for non-academic attendees), we will
    provide a guest account for you.
2. Their Eduroam accounts through their home institutions. You will need online access to complete the
   hands-on exercises, log in to remote systems, view documentation, etc., so please make sure you can
   sign in to Eduroam. If not sure how to obtain it, please contact the local IT department at your
   institution. We have secured some temporary Wifi accounts as well.
   - The desks in the rooms have Ethernet sockets for wired access. If you do not have an Eduroam
     account, and your laptop has an Ethernet port, you may want to bring an Ethernet cable to plug in.
